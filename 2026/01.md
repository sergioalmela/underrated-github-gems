## 🏆 Top 3 Picks

### 🥇 #1 - pasteguard
**Repo:** [`sgasser/pasteguard`](https://github.com/sgasser/pasteguard)
**Language:** TypeScript
**Why it stands out:** A privacy proxy that sanitizes PII before it reaches any LLM, directly addressing the "shadow AI" compliance crisis in companies. Employees paste sensitive data into ChatGPT and Claude every day — pasteguard intercepts and scrubs it using Presidio-based detection. Well-structured TypeScript codebase with clear architecture and immediately deployable.

**Highlights:**
- Intercepts and sanitizes PII before LLM submission
- Presidio-based entity detection
- Addresses real enterprise compliance needs
- Clean TypeScript architecture, ready to deploy

### 🥈 #2 - coi
**Repo:** [`io-eric/coi`](https://github.com/io-eric/coi)
**Language:** C++
**Why it stands out:** A bold new programming language purpose-built for high-performance web apps with WASM and fine-grained reactivity. Instead of adding yet another framework on top of JavaScript, Coi tackles frontend performance at the compiler level with type safety and deterministic performance guarantees. A technically stunning achievement for compiler and web architecture enthusiasts.

**Highlights:**
- Custom compiler targeting WebAssembly
- Fine-grained reactivity built into the language
- Type-safe with deterministic performance
- MIT licensed with active development

### 🥉 #3 - unsloth-mlx
**Repo:** [`ARahim3/unsloth-mlx`](https://github.com/ARahim3/unsloth-mlx)
**Language:** Python
**Why it stands out:** Brings the popular Unsloth LLM training optimizations to Apple Silicon via the MLX framework. Before this, Mac users were largely excluded from efficient model fine-tuning. This project opens the door for a massive user base to train and customize models locally without needing NVIDIA hardware.

**Highlights:**
- Unsloth optimizations ported to Apple's MLX
- Enables LLM fine-tuning on Mac hardware
- Removes NVIDIA dependency for training
- Python-based, accessible to ML practitioners

## 🔖 Honorable Mentions

### MirageKit
**Repo:** [`EthanLipnik/MirageKit`](https://github.com/EthanLipnik/MirageKit)
**Language:** Swift
**Why it stands out:** A sophisticated P2P screen sharing framework spanning the entire Apple ecosystem — macOS to visionOS and iPad. This is real systems engineering dealing with networking, media streams, and cross-device coordination, not another API wrapper.

### roborev
**Repo:** [`roborev-dev/roborev`](https://github.com/roborev-dev/roborev)
**Language:** Go
**Why it stands out:** A background code review tool built for the AI agent era. Uses a TUI to monitor and review agent-generated code non-invasively, letting developers stay in control without interrupting the flow. A clever developer experience tool for modern AI-assisted workflows.
